# Linear regression using student grade data
Linear regression is a type of supervised machine learning algorithm that computes the linear relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent features. When the number of the independent feature, is 1 then it is known as Univariate Linear regression, and in the case of more than one feature, it is known as multivariate linear regression. The goal of the algorithm is to find the best linear equation that can predict the value of the dependent variable based on the independent variables. The equation provides a straight line that represents the relationship between the dependent and independent variables. The slope of the line indicates how much the dependent variable changes for a unit change in the independent variable(s).

This project will help you to understand linear regression
We're using student grade data set and we're using some parameters like using two semester marks and absence details and study hours to predict third semester marks using these data and we're using matplotlib to visualize the predictions.
