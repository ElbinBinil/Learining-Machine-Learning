# Linear Regression

Linear Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for predicting continuous numeric values. It establishes a linear relationship between the input features and the target variable by fitting a linear equation to the observed data.

## Algorithm Overview

The Linear Regression algorithm follows a simple and intuitive approach:

1. **Step 1: Load the Training Data**
   - Load the labeled dataset containing instances with input features and corresponding target values.
   - Each instance consists of a feature vector (independent variable) and its corresponding target value (dependent variable).

2. **Step 2: Establish a Hypothesis Function**
   - Choose a hypothesis function that represents the linear relationship between the input features and the target variable.
   - In simple linear regression, the hypothesis function is of the form: `y = mx + b`, where `m` is the slope (coefficient) and `b` is the y-intercept.

3. **Step 3: Estimate Coefficients**
   - Use a technique such as Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) or gradient descent to estimate the coefficients (`m` and `b`) that minimize the sum of squared errors between the predicted and actual target values.

4. **Step 4: Make Predictions**
   - Once the coefficients are estimated, apply the hypothesis function to new input feature values to predict the corresponding target value.

5. **Step 5: Evaluate the Model**
   - Assess the performance of the linear regression model using appropriate evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), or R-squared.

6. **Step 6: Output Prediction**
   - Output the predicted target values for new input feature values.

## Key Considerations

- **Assumptions:** Linear regression assumes that there is a linear relationship between the input features and the target variable. Additionally, it assumes that the residuals (the differences between the predicted and actual values) are normally distributed and have constant variance.

- **Feature Scaling:** Feature scaling is not required in linear regression since the coefficients adjust for the scale of the input features. However, if there is a large difference in the magnitudes of the features, feature scaling may help in achieving better convergence during the estimation of coefficients.

- **Multivariate Linear Regression:** Linear regression can be extended to handle multiple input features. The hypothesis function becomes `y = b0 + b1*x1 + b2*x2 + ... + bn*xn`, where `x1, x2, ..., xn` are the input features, and `b0, b1, b2, ..., bn` are the coefficients.

## Conclusion

Linear Regression is a widely used algorithm for predicting continuous numeric values. By fitting a linear equation to the observed data, it provides a straightforward and interpretable model. However, it is important to consider the assumptions of linear regression and evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
