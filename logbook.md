# Machine Learning Study Logbook

This logbook tracks my progress and learnings in the field of machine learning. It serves as a record of the topics I have studied, the resources I have used, and any code or projects associated with them.

## Log Entries

### Entry 1: Linear regression 

- **Date:** 16/07/2023
- **Description:** Studied about Linear regression and how to check for accuracy and tweak it
- **Resources:** Use this [video](https://youtu.be/i_LwzRVP7bg?t=2683) as reference to understand this concept clearly 
- **Code/Projects:** I made a simple project which predicts student grade using some data which you can find in the [repo](https://github.com/ElbinBinil/Learining-Machine-Learning/tree/main/linear_regression) using scikit learn and visualized the data with matplotlib 

### Entry 2: K nearest neighbours (KNN) algorithm

- **Date:** 19/07/2023
- **Description:** Learned how to process and clean the dataset according to our need and also find new way to predict the data using the KNN algorithm
- **Resources:** This [video](https://youtu.be/WFr2WgN9_xE?t=4096) was so helpful to understand the concept
- **Code/Projects:** There is a simple project in this [repo](https://github.com/ElbinBinil/Learining-Machine-Learning/tree/main/knearest) which helps you to understand this concept clearly. We're using some car data set to predict its class
