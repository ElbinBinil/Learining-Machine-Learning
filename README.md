# Machine Learning Study Log

Welcome to my Machine Learning Study Log repository! This repository serves as a logbook to track my progress, learnings, and resources related to machine learning.

## Motivation

The main purpose of this repository is to document my journey in studying machine learning. By maintaining a study log, I aim to:

- Keep track of the concepts and techniques I have learned
- Review my progress over time
- Share my knowledge with others who might find it helpful
- Build a valuable resource for future reference

## Log Entries

I maintain a logbook of my study progress in the [logbook.md](logbook.md) file. Each log entry consists of a brief description of the topic studied, relevant resources used, and any code or projects associated with it. I update the log regularly to reflect my ongoing learning.

Feel free to explore the logbook to get an idea of the topics I've covered and my progress in the field.

## Topics Covered

In this repository, I cover a wide range of machine learning topics, including but not limited to:

- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning
- Deep Learning
- Neural Networks
- Natural Language Processing
- Computer Vision
- Reinforcement Learning
- Data Preprocessing
- Feature Engineering
- Model Evaluation
- Model Deployment

The repository is organized into directories based on different subtopics, making it easy to navigate and locate specific areas of interest.

## Resources

Besides my study log, I also maintain a [resources.md](resources.md) file that lists the various resources I've found helpful in my learning journey. These resources include online courses, tutorials, books, research papers, and articles. Each resource is accompanied by a brief description and a link for easy access.

Feel free to explore the resources file to discover valuable learning materials that can aid your own studies.
